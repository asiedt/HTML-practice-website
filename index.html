    <p> This is the beginning of a paragraph. It's nothing fancy yet. </p>
    <p> This is the beginning of another paragraph. 
      It has different   spacing   in  the 
      source code 
      but the browser    ignores it </p>
    <p> This paragraph is going to have spacing because it features a poem. <br> This poem is titled "This Is Just To Say" by William Carlos Williams </p>
