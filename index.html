     <p> Now I'm going to get very fancy and start adding images. First we will have a photo of a plum <br> <img src=https://www.sousvidetools.com/toolshed/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/plums.jpg" alt="Pictures of Plums" style="width:500px;height:600px;"> </p>

       Lets practice making tables. Here we go. I am going to make the table for rice making that is on the back of the rice package from Target. <br> I will also make an order list of the instructions. 
       <br> So I guess this will be helpful if you want to make some rice. 
       <table style ="width 100%">
       <tr>
       <th> Servings </th>
       <th> Water </th>
       <th> Rice </th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
       <td> 2 </td>
       <td> 1 cup </td>
       <td> 1/2 cup </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
       <td> 4 </td>
       <td> 2 cups </td>
       <td> 1 cup </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
       <td> 6 </td>
       <td> 3 cups </td>
       <td> 1-1/2 cups </td>
       </tr>
       </table>
       <ol>
       <li> Bring water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add butter and salt to taste, if desired. </li>
       <li> Stir in rice; cover. </li>
       <li> Reduce heat; simmer 20 minutes or until all water is absorbed and rice is tender. For firmer rice, use less water </li>
       </ol>
       </p>
